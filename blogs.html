        <h2 class="blog-heading-style">→ What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="blog-content-style">JavaScript is a versatile scripting language. While it has grown up significantly
            and is used mainly in
            web
            development, it has also picked up steam in desktop app development as well. Aside from its versatility,
            JavaScript has benefited a lot from the adoption of Node JS which enabled the language to become better
            for
            real-time apps, graphics generation, and data visualization. JavaScript allows developers to write code
            that
            helps websites interact with users. Moreover, it can be combined with HTML and CSS to create interactive
            features often seen in web startups today such as buttons that change depending on what action the user
            performs on them. .Java is a general-purpose programming language. Java mostly focuses on the
            development of
            software systems that run on servers, desktop applications, mobile apps and embedded devices. It is one
            of
            the most popular programming languages in the world because it allows multiple platforms to be developed
            at
            once with a single codebase or application. Java has been around since 1995.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading-style">→ What is ReactJS?</h2>
        <p class="blog-content-style">React is a library for building UI views with Javascript. It's built on top of the
            Facebook library called ReactDOM, which provides some helper functions for working with HTML and CSS in
            JavaScript. The main reasons that people like React are because it's easy to use (no previous experience
            required), flexible (it can be used in any web application), and fast (it renders your pages faster than
            other libraries).</p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading-style">→ What is Component?</h2>
        <p class="blog-content-style" style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">A component is a reusable piece of UI built with
            HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
            Components can be nested in other React components to form larger components that are composed together to
            form a complete interface.
            Each component is self-contained and presents some part of the UI, allowing you to write less code and focus
            on what matters most: the content.
            The main benefits of using components include:
            <ul class="blog-un-list" style="margin-bottom: 5rem;">
                <li>-Easier to maintain and reuse code.</li>
                <li>-Improved performance.</li>
                <li>-Reduced file size and faster page load time.</li>
                <li>-Improved readability and maintainability.</li>
                <li>-Easier to test and debug.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
